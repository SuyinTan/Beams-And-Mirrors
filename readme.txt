Code Assignment: Mirrors and Lasers

There are 2 main classes and 2 helper classes. Main classes include "Safe" and "BeamDriver".
"Safe" contains the setup of the mirror grid, while "BeamDriver" contains a "Safe" object
and is responsible for driving the inner workings of the laser beam.
Helper classes include "Position" and "MirrorObj".

How to compile:
Open the Linux terminal, and cd to the directory of the source files.
Key in command to compile
g++ Main.cpp Safe.cpp BeamDriver.cpp 
OR
g++ *.cpp 

How to run the program:
1. Key in command "$ a.out", and start to key in inputs. 
The input format follows the instructions of the assignment.
2. You may input multiple test cases. 
3. At the end of your inputs, key in an empty line.
The program will start to processing inputs upon receiving an empty line.

Alternatively, if you wish to use a file to stream in your inputs,
in the command line, key in "$ a.out < input.txt". 
Make sure your input.txt ends with an empty line.s
